# British Airways Reviews

This repository contains a Python script to scrape and analyze customer reviews for British Airways from [airlinequality.com](https://www.airlinequality.com/).

- Implements headers to mimic browser requests and avoid being blocked.
- Supports saving scraped data to a specific directory for organized file management.
